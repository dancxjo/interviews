		<h1>Teacups in a Swimming Pool</h1>
		<p>How many teacups are in an olympic-sized swimming pool?</p>
		<h2>Solution</h2>
		<p>Obviously, there's no exact answer here since teacups and Olympic-sized swimming 
			pools aren't standardized. However, the number of cups in a rectangular prism of 
			the dimensions 		
			<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic-sized swimming pool">50 meters by 25 meters by 3 meters</a>
			is <script>
			var length = 50; // meters
			var width = 25;  // meters
			var depth = 3;   // meters
			
			var poolVolume = length * width * depth; // m^3
			
			var cupsInACubicMeter = 4226.75;
			
			document.write((poolVolume * cupsInACubicMeter).toLocaleString());								
		</script>.</p>
		
		<h1>Disjunction of an Array</h1>
		<p>You are given two arrays, A and B. B contains all the elements of A plus one 
		additional element that is not a member of A. Find the most efficient algorithm
		to find the differing element.</p><aside>Dear Gussy! This was for a help desk 
		job. I'm trying to do some independent research into algorithm optimization, but 
		it was a support role, for goodness' sake!</aside>
		<h2>Solution I Provided</h2>
		<p>
			This is a naive approach and clearly not the most efficient.
			Iterate over B comparing every element of B to every element of A.
			<pre>
			<script>
				function compareArrays(A, B) {
					
				}
				
				document.write(compareArrays([4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42], [42, 16, 8, 23, 15, 2]));
			</script>
