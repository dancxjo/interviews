		<h1>Teacups in a Swimming Pool</h1>
		<p>How many teacups are in an olympic-sized swimming pool?</p>
		<h2>Solution</h2>
		<p>Obviously, there's no exact answer here since teacups and Olympic-sized swimming 
			pools aren't standardized. However, the number of cups in a rectangular prism of 
			the dimensions 		
			<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic-sized swimming pool">50 meters by 25 meters by 3 meters</a>
			is <script>
			var length = 50; // meters
			var width = 25;  // meters
			var depth = 3;   // meters
			
			var poolVolume = length * width * depth; // m^3
			
			var cupsInACubicMeter = 4226.75;
			
			document.write((poolVolume * cupsInACubicMeter).toLocaleString());								
		</script>.</p>
